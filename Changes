 - Bug fix: the Moose global destruction flag is respected when the
   Startable destructor is called.

 - Errors encountered while stopping Startable external processes are
   now logged without then re-throwing the error. The process STDERR
   is now captured.

 - Added a pipe method to Runnable to allow them to be piped together
   using IPC::Run's pipe support.

Release 0.4.2
